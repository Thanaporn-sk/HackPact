# HackPact
A one month experimentation with sound, algorithms, visual music and unconventional sequencers
(See each folder for specific info)

### Aesthetic constrains:
- sound should affect the graphics and/or vice versa
- more problem framing, less problem solving


### Technological constrains:
- code is open sourced & reusable

### Learning Goals
- escape the comfort zone: think in space (3d) instead of a 2d canvas 
- webgl with [p5js](https://p5js.org/) or [threejs](https://threejs.org/)
- web based sound synthesis with [tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io/)
- modern javascript with modules, ES6, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
