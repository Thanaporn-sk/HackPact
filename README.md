# HackPact
A one month experimentation with sound, algorithms, visual music and unconventional sequencers
(See each folder for specific info)

### Aesthetic constrains:
- sound should affect the graphics and/or vice versa
- more problem framing, less problem solving


### Technological constrains:
- code is open sourced & reusable

### Learning Goals
- escape the comfort zone: think in space (3d) instead of a 2d canvas 
- webgl with [p5js](https://p5js.org/) or [threejs](https://threejs.org/)
- web based sound synthesis with [tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io/)
- modern javascript with modules, ES6, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### Inspiration
Indicated per folder. Also, notice that the [Nature of Code](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js/) by Daniel Shiffman and some excellent ideas on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) are always in the scope. Interesting resources can be found also at [Chrome Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/) and [Tero Parvianen](https://teropa.info/). && >>> Fluxus @@. Ideas and projects from our group [Binaura](http://binaura.net) are also meriting from these cross-modal sonic traditions 

### Live Demos
Try out all the sketches [here](https://stc.github.io/HackPact/). Please note, they are quick protos, not optimized for anything
